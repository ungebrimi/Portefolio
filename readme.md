# My portefolio

This is my defined version of a portefolio for a while, atleast until i get a fun new idea.

It's been a great experience to make and I've learnt alot on threejs.
the setup is taken from the course threejs-journey course by Bruno Simon. so all credits to him for a great course. and for the setup of a scene.

for inqueries please contact me
